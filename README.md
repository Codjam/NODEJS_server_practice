# NODEJS_server_practice

Clone the repo,<br>
Navigate to the folder (NODEJS_server_practice),<br>
type in "npm start" run it in the browser (I used http://localhost:7000/),<br>
Type some text,<br>
Check your terminal and text editor for changes.<br>
Go do some exercise and get outside and see nature.<br>
This is basic learning that I needed to get better in NodeJS.<br>
Peace!!!

Templating Engines:
I picked ejs because thats what I am working with for another project.
