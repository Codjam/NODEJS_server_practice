# NODEJS_server_practice
Clone the repo,
Navigate to the folder (NODEJS_server_practice),
type in "node app.js" run it in the browser (I used http://localhost:7000/),
Type some text,
Check your terminal and text editor for changes.
Go do some exercise and get outside and see nature.
This is basic learning that I needed to get better in NodeJS.
Peace!
